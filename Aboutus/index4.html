             Craigslist (stylized as craigslist) is an American classified advertisements website with sections devoted to jobs, 
             housing, for sale, items wanted, services, community service, gigs, résumés, and discussion forums.<br><br> 
             Craig Newmark began the service in 1995 as an email distribution list to friends, featuring local events in the San 
             Francisco Bay Area. It became a web-based service in 1996 and expanded into other classified categories. 
             It started expanding to other U.S. cities in 2000, and now covers 70 countries. <br><br>In March 2008, Spanish, French, 
             Italian, German, and Portuguese became the first non-English languages Craigslist supported.[5] As of August 9, 
             2012, over 700 cities and areas in 70 countries had Craigslist sites.[6] Some Craigslist sites cover large regions 
             instead of individual metropolitan areas—for example, the U.S. states of Delaware and Wyoming, the Colorado Western 
             Slope, the California Gold Country, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are among the locations with their own 
             Craigslist sites.[7] Craigslist sites for some large cities, such as Los Angeles, also include the ability 
             for the user to focus on a specific area of a city (such as central Los Angeles).<br><br> Craigslist (stylized as craigslist)
